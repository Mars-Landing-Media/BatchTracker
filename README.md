   - Exportable reports ensure easy sharing and audit compliance.  

3. **Automated XML Export**:  
   - Effortlessly export update set XML files directly from the Batch Tracker interface.  
   - Reduces manual effort during large-scale promotions or migrations.  

4. **Scope Deconfliction Support**:  
   - Detect and resolve conflicts in update sets across multiple application scopes.  
   - Visual indicators highlight conflicts, helping teams prioritize resolution.  
   - Log detailed information about conflicting records for faster troubleshooting.
